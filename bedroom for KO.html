		<p> Organizing shoes can be a hard thing to do, especially when they are for little feet! By separating your children's different types of shoes in different designed binder holders, will keep their closet much more organized, and much easier to find a matching pair of shoes. <p/>

		<p>Loosing remotes and game controllers, and flipping the house upside down looking fo them can be such a pain! By putting a piece of velcro on the back of a remote, and a piece of velcro in the cabinet, or on the table will help you never loose a remote again!!! <p/>

	<p>Stepping on Barbie shoes, or even legos can really hurt! By hangning a shoe organizer on the door, and organizing your children's toys in them will help prevent stepping on toys, now since there is a place for the toys other then the floor. <p/>
